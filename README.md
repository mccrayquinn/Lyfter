# Lyfter: Ride-Hailing Application
Developers: Chirag Rana, Michael Schaming, Steve Yu, Quinn Mccray, and Pauleene Adirea Jordan
# Problem Statement/Goal
Lyfter is an app-based personal vehicle system (i.e., ride-hailing), and they approach your team for help in designing a system that allows them to efficiently match riders to drivers. They want your team to help them claim “the wait time is never more than 5 minutes”, and thus in determining how many drivers they should recruit if they anticipate 100 riders at any instant of time.
# Introduction and Approach:
In order to create this application, the approach that was taken was using the Android Studio software to write to code and test out written code on an Android device. The program was written in Java. The database to store our user information was the Google Firebase Database. We also used a Google Maps API, that allowed us to display a map with accurate distances. Our application is designed to operate at Rutgers New Brunswick, as calculations for wait time and the necessary number of drivers needed for 100 riders were based on this specific city.

Common functions in this implementation were reused from similar projects, as software reuse plays a critical part in the design and implmenetation stage of software engineering.
# Evaluation of Requirements, Design, and Estimate Time:
The requirements that Lyfter has asked for have been met. To test, we used only New Brunswick with a set number of drivers, and we chose several locations for these subjects. The city of New Brunswick can be representative of however large Lyfter would like to expand. We conducted a series of tests to ensure that no matter where the driver/rider was in the city, the wait or pick-up time from the driver to the rider was never more than 5 mins. In order to achieve this, the calculation for wait time and the number of drivers was based on the average speed limit for the city and the distance the drivers were from the riders. We designed our program to calculate the closest available driver by incrementing the radius around the customer by 1 in each iteration until a driver has been found. This can help ensure the smallest wait time. Our program design also ensures that drivers that have completed their task will be available once again for use to ensure that the maximum number of drivers are available, for at most 100 riders. We have ensured that our database is consistently up to date and that we are always updating the locations of riders and drivers to ensure that customer pickup and driver locations are as accurate as possible. In addition to these functional requirements, several non-functional requirements have also been taken care of such as reliability, ease of use, and security.
# How to Use Test Out Application from Github:
In order to run the application (for testing purposes), the zip folder must be downloaded and opened in Android Studio. The user should then open the emulator and run the application. The application. The user that is testing should choose whether they would like to see a driver or rider interface. Once selected, the user should create an account with a valid login format. The username should have the format XXXXX@XXXXX.com and the password should be more than 6 characters. Once logged in, the driver should see the location, and the rider should see the location and be able to request a ride.
